# video-player
Our video player project.

# Note:
Download the Live Server extension for VS Code ane use it to test our code (will run code in a browser instead of 
a live preview window. This allows for the <video> tag to function as intended). To launch a Live Server instance,
open the .html file you want to run in VS Code's text editor, then press ALT+L+O. This will launch a Live Server
through your browser and allow for more robust functionality testing.

# 1. Get everyone into the GitHub repo (contributors)
LoganZ3, zc1778, HunterWillis12, SmoCloud, Neptunes22

# 2. Divide workload
I was thinking that maybe we could do teams where one team is responsible for one portion of the project.
By this, I mean the project is going to be using HTML, CSS, and JS (presumably), so I was thinking that
we divide the workload based on that. One team responsible for the HTML, one for the CSS, and one for the JS.

# 3. Assign Tasks
There's front-end page layout and scripting work to be done (assigned to Mikel Cox) as well as back-end database 
and web socket work to be done (unassigned).
