# video-player
Our video player project.

# 1. Get everyone into the GitHub repo (contributors)
LoganZ3, zc1778, HunterWillis12, SmoCloud

# 2. Divide workload
I was thinking that maybe we could do teams where one team is responsible for one portion of the project.
By this, I mean the project is going to be using HTML, CSS, and JS (presumably), so I was thinking that
we divide the workload based on that. One team responsible for the HTML, one for the CSS, and one for the JS.
